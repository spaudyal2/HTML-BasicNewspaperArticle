            <h1>Erling Haaland: Manchester City striker adds hat-trick feat to growing list of records</h1>
            <h2>By Phil Dawkes- BBC News</h2>
            <h3>January 22, 2023</h3>

            <p><strong>Erling Haaland has more Premier League hat-tricks than Cristiano Ronaldo. He has the same number as Mohamed Salah. He is a third of the way towards Sergio Aguero's record tally of 12.</strong></p>

            <p>Haaland has been in England's top flight for half a season. That's 19 league games in total. On Sunday, in Manchester City's comfortable 3-0 win over Wolves, the Norwegian struck his fourth treble, completing it in just 12 minutes either side of half-time.</p>

            <p>It took his tally of goals for the campaign to a stunning 31 in all competitions - 25 of them in the Premier League. Some records have already been broken, others beckon. In the aftermath of his latest goalscoring feat, BBC Sport celebrates the phenomenon that is Erling Braut Haaland.</p>

            <p>As already stated, Haaland's quartet of hat-tricks have come from just 19 Premier League games. To show just how ludicrously quick that is, the next fastest person to reach the same number of Premier League trebles is Ruud van Nistelrooy, who scored his fourth in his 65th Manchester United league game.</p>

            <p>Aguero, who was Haaland's predecessor up front for City, scored 12 Premier League hat-tricks during his time in England. No player has managed more. Of the players currently active in England, Tottenham's Harry Kane has the most with eight. But the Argentine, who is City's all-time leading goalscorer with 184, played 275 Premier League games for the club.</p>

            <p>Alan Shearer, who has netted more Premier League goals than anyone with 260, scored 11 trebles. He is the only man to have scored more than Haaland in a single season, with five - that being the 1995-96 campaign in which he scored 31 times.</p>

            <p>Haaland's tally of goals in all competitions this season has already matched Shearer's 1995-96 league total. Shearer won the Golden Boot that year, with his 31 the joint-fourth highest number of goals ever scored in a Premier League season, three fewer than the 34 the striker netted for Blackburn in 1994-95 and Andy Cole scored for Newcastle the season before.</p>

            <p>Haaland is on 25 already - a total would have been enough to earn him the Golden Boot in more than half of the 30 campaigns since the English top flight was renamed in 1992. It is already enough goals to have made him the division's top scorer in any of the past four seasons.</p>

            <p>Kane, three times a Golden Boot winner, is the closest man to Haaland in the scoring charts for this season - 10 goals behind. Haaland's efforts on Sunday also toppled another City record, his 18 home league goals being the most scored by one of the club's players at Etihad Stadium in a single season, beating Sergio Aguero's total of 16 in 2011-12.</p>

            <p>He needs one more goal to match Aguero's record of 26 for the most scored by a City player in a Premier League season but still has a bit of work to beat the 38 netted by Tommy Johnson in the old First Division in 1928-29. If he matches his output from the first half of the campaign in the second, that will give him a nice neat 50 for the campaign.</p>
